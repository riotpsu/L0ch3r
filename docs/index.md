# About

Welcome to a site designed to expose the evildoing of <a href="https://herlocherfoods.com">Herlocher Foods</a>, and the people who are the evildoers.  

The Herlochers claim to have "saved" the Rathskellar, but what they have really done is set up an elaborate ruse.  Those who aren't paying enough attention think that the Herlochers saved the building from demolition, and that they are preserving a historic site in State College.  In reality, the Herlochers have manufactured this story (poorly, like their mustard) to promote their brand and make you think they are doing good.  They were never going to demolish the building; only remove the current occupants and sell at a higher rate.

### 2018 Feb 13 - "The owners of the since-closed Rathskeller are being taken to court by the Herlocher family"
> Neil and Chuck Herlocher of Herlocher's Dipping Mustard claim Duke and Monica Gastiger removed property from the location they say was supposed to remain on the premises, according to the Gastiger's prior lease agreement. 
>
> According to the complaint filed by Herlochers, the Gastigers had “removed fixtures of the property, including but not limited to tables which were anchored to the floor, booths and other items permanently affixed to the property.”
>
> The complaint was served by Centre County deputy sheriff to Duke Gastiger on Feb. 5. The Gastiger family responded saying they only removed personal property, such as liquor inventory, records and other decorations and furnishings.

### 2018 Feb 02 - Is the Skeller being gutted? The Herlochers and Gastigers give their sides of the story.

> The Rathskeller is being “gutted,” according to property owners Neil and Sharon Herlocher.
> 
> Duke Gastiger and wife Monica own the Skeller. He said it’s only right to take what belongs to the business following the bar’s Saturday closure and before their lease ends Feb. 28.
> 
> “We are taking the assets of the corporation, which is our personal property,” Duke Gastiger said. “We are not taking anything that is the landlord’s property. That’s all I can really say. I would say gutting is a pretty bad word. That's not true.”
> 
> The Herlochers and Gastigers disagree on who owns what at the property — a Dec. 5 letter from the Herlochers’ attorney to the Gastigers’ lawyers made clear that the property should not be ripped apart. The letter included several pages of the lease that said alterations could not be made to the property.
> 
> A response by the Gastigers’ attorney on Dec. 20 said they had no intention to “trash the place,” but said that sometimes fans of landmarks like baseball stadiums take what they want and perhaps the bathrooms should be guarded.
> 
> Duke Gastiger said it would not be necessary to describe what was being taken, though he indicated that the main bar would not be touched.
> 
> Fixtures like the tables and booths were being torn out and removed on Thursday, according to Sharon Herlocher who was at the building to address a maintenance issue.
> 
> The Herlochers said they are “devastated this historic landmark has been gutted.”
> 
> “Our intent all along has been to preserve this building,” Sharon Herlocher said. “Unfortunately, due to this vandalism, it’s going to take more effort to do so. But we remain steadfast in our commitment to this property, this community and to downtown State College.”
> 
> There has been no communication between the Gastigers and Tom and Kelley Trosko about a purchase for the business since the new tenants and their plans were revealed on Saturday, the same day the Skeller and Spats closed. Spats will continue operate as part of a new restaurant with the Allen Street Grill.
> 
> “We have just received information from our landlord that the current tenant has gutted the Skeller,” Tom and Kelley Trosko said in a statement. “Although we are disappointed, our passion and commitment to preserve this historic landmark will not waver.”
> 
> Each side has maintained different accounts about whether an offer was made for the business several months ago.
> 
> The Herlochers said an offer was made for the Rathskeller’s liquor license and business during an Oct. 25 meeting with Duke Gastiger who said the only proposal ever made was for half the value of the liquor license.
> 
> After that meeting, when Duke Gastiger said he was informed he would no longer be a tenant, he asked the Herlochers in an emailthat the news about the closings be confidential, particularly so his employees wouldn’t find out from anyone else.
> 
> Neil Herlocher agreed to keep the news secret in an Oct. 26 email, which also indicated a willingness to negotiate a deal for the business and liquor license followed by an announcement after the football season.
> 
> Duke Gastiger said he was not interested in negotiating with the Herlochers after he learned he could not continue to operate the Skeller and Spats. He said several requests were made to be in direct contact with the new tenants to discuss a sale of the business and the employment of his staff, but that his inquiries went unanswered.
> 
> The Gastigers announced the closings on Dec. 4, the same day they told their employees they would no longer operate the businesses.
> 
> No decision has been made on what to do with memorabilia and furniture from the Rathskeller, according to Duke Gastiger.
> 
> “We are trying to be fair,” Duke Gastiger said. “The place will be cleaned. We aren’t destroying anything. We’re really just removing assets, and we really didn’t want to leave like this. It all could have been handled with a simple phone call from the new tenants to us. They made no attempt to contact us and had plenty of opportunities. I’m sorry that the Herlochers and Tom and his wife thought they could walk into the Skeller as it was, but that’s not the case.”

### 2017 Dec 05 - Save the Skeller: Herlochers Release Open Letter to State College and Penn State Community

> Save The Skeller: An Open Letter To The Penn State and State College Community
> 
> We value the outpouring of emotions from Penn Staters and State College natives surrounding the news about the All-American Rathskeller and Foster Building.
> 
> We are eager to address peoples’ concerns about the future. We bought the Foster Building to preserve this downtown landmark. We are NOT tearing it down. We are NOT replacing it with a high rise.
> 
> We are a family of Penn Staters and State College natives who live here, work here and are raising our family here. We walk the downtown streets every day and savor the sights, sounds and the unique feel of what makes this the best college town in America.
> 
> We, like many of you, believe that certain things should remain.
> 
> That is why we acted, to prevent this landmark building from vanishing from the College Avenue landscape. When it became clear that the current operator arrangement would not continue, we carefully considered the next steps.
> 
> A national franchise was NOT a consideration.
> 
> So what comes next? The Skeller has remained a constant across 84 years and multiple operators and building owners. This is the place where our shared memories live. We all want this to endure as a place that has bound people to one another across generations.
> 
> Before the New Year, we will announce the new operators. Rest assured, these Penn Staters share your passion and have great familiarity with the Skeller and its rich history.
> 
> Their vision is to continue operating it the way you’ve always known it. Part of that is an inclusive approach. They want all of us engaged on a website and social media sharing memories and ideas ensuring the future will grow directly from the hearts of patrons past and present. Details on that effort will be forthcoming with the announcement of the new operators.
> 
> As one of America’s truly unique college bars and locations, this is a community treasure. From the start, we understood the responsibility to honor the tradition. We believe together, we will create a future that reflects the goal of all who want to #SaveTheSkeller.
> 
> The Herlocher Family

> Update 12:25 p.m. Tues., December 5: Despite removing Facebook reviews, Amazon reviews are still up and running for Herlocher’s Dipping Mustard, and Skeller supporters have started to migrate there, as well. So far, the mustard has nine “critical reviews.”

>
> Chuck and Neil Herlocher — yes, those Herlochers — bought the property in June, and told Center County Gazette at the time, “Business there will continue as usual.”
>
> This is certainly not “as usual” and Penn Staters are acutely aware of it, so much that they’ve started a movement to boycott Herlocher’s Foods, starting with the company’s reviews on Facebook and Amazon.
>
> At time of publication Monday night, the company had racked up more than 150 one-star reviews.
