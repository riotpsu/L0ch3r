### 2018 Feb 13 - "The owners of the since-closed Rathskeller are being taken to court by the Herlocher family"
<div style="background-color:"#e8e8e8;">

Neil and Chuck Herlocher of Herlocher's Dipping Mustard claim Duke and Monica Gastiger removed property from the location they say was supposed to remain on the premises, according to the Gastiger's prior lease agreement.
<br><br>
According to the complaint filed by Herlochers, the Gastigers had “removed fixtures of the property, including but not limited to tables which were anchored to the floor, booths and other items permanently affixed to the property.”
<br><br>
The complaint was served by Centre County deputy sheriff to Duke Gastiger on Feb. 5. The Gastiger family responded saying they only removed personal property, such as liquor inventory, records and other decorations and furnishings.
